# esp_wifi_repeater
A full functional WiFi Repeater (correctly: a WiFi NAT Router)

This is a proof of concept implementation of a WiFi NAT router on the esp8266. It can be used as range extender for an existing WiFi network. The esp acts as STA and as soft-AP and transparently forwards any IP traffic through it. As it uses NAT no routing entries are required neither on the network side nor on the connected stations. Stations are configured via DHCP by default in the 192.168.4.0/24 net and receive their DNS responder address from the existing WiFi network.

Measurements show, that it can achieve about 5 Mbps in both directions, so even streaming is possible.

The router also allows for remote monitoring (or packet sniffing), e.g. with Wireshark. 

Some details are explained in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM2FqnMFCLw

# First Boot
The esp_wifi_repeater starts with the following default configuration:
- ssid: ssid, password: password
- ap_ssid: MyAP, ap_password: none, ap_on: 1, ap_open: 1
- network: 192.168.4.0/24

After first boot (or factory reset) it will offer a WiFi network with an open AP and the ssid "MyAP". Connect to this WiFi network and do the basic configuration either via a simple web interface or the full config with all options via the console. 

# Basic Web Config Interface
The web interface allows for the configuration of all parameters required for the basic forwarding functionality. Thanks to rubfi for the major work on that: https://github.com/rubfi/esp_wifi_repeater/ . Point your browser to "http://192.168.4.1". This page should appear:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/WebConfig.jpg">

First enter the appropriate values for the uplink WiFi network, the "STA Settings", and click "Connect". The ESP reboots and will connect to your WiFi router. The status LED should be blinking after some seconds.

Now you can reload the page and change the "Soft AP Settings". Click "Set" and again the ESP reboots. Now it is ready for forwarding traffic over the newly configured Soft AP. Be aware that these changes also affect the config interface, i.e. to do further configuration, connect to the ESP through one of the newly configured WiFi networks. For access through the Soft AP remember the address of the Soft APs network if you have changed that (the ESP has always the adress x.x.x.1 in this network).

If you like, you can mark the "lock" checkbox and click "Lock". Now the config cannot be changed anymore without first unlocking it with the uplink WiFi network's password (define one even if the network is open).

If you did a mistake and you lost any contact with ESP you can still use the serial console to recover it ("reset facory", see below).

# Command Line Interface
Advanced configuration has to be done via the command line on the console interface. This console is available either via the serial port at 115200 baud or via tcp port 7777 (e.g. "telnet 192.168.4.1 7777" from a connected STA).

Use the following commands for an initial setup:
- set ssid your_home_router's_SSID
- set password your_home_router's_password
- set ap_ssid ESP's_ssid
- set ap_password ESP's_password
- show (to check the parameters)
- save
- reset

If you want to enter non-ASCII or special characters on the command line you can use quoting: either use C-style quotes with backslash like this "My\ AccessPoint" or use HTTP-style hex encoding like "My%20AccessPoint". Both methods will result in a string "My AccessPoint". With the hex encoding you can enter any byte value you like, except for 0 (for C-internal reasons).

The command line understands a lot more commands:

Basic commands (enough to get it working in nearly all environments):
- help: prints a short help message
- set [ssid|password] _value_: changes the settings for the uplink AP (WiFi config of your home-router)
- set [ap_ssid|ap_password] _value_: changes the settings for the soft-AP of the ESP (for your stations)
- show [config|stats]: prints the current config or some status information and statistics
- save [dhcp]: saves the current config parameters [+ the current DHCP leases] to flash
- lock [_password_]: saves and locks the current config, changes are not allowed. Password can be left open if already set before (Default is the password of the uplink WiFi)
- unlock _password_: unlocks the config, requires password from the lock command
- reset [factory]: resets the esp, 'factory' optionally resets WiFi params to default values (works on a locked device only from serial console)
- quit: terminates a remote session

Advanced commands:
(Most of the set-commands are effective only after save and reset)
- set network _ip-addr_: sets the IP address of the internal network, network is always /24, router is always x.x.x.1
- set dns _dns-addr_: sets a static DNS address that is distributed to clients via DHCP
- set dns dhcp: configures use of the dynamic DNS address from DHCP, default
- set ip _ip-addr_: sets a static IP address for the ESP in the uplink network
- set ip dhcp: configures dynamic IP address for the ESP in the uplink network, default
- set netmask _netmask_: sets a static netmask for the uplink network
- set gw _gw-addr_: sets a static gateway address in the uplink network
- set bssid _xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx_: sets the specific BSSID of the uplink IP to connect to (default 00:00:00:00:00:00 which means any)
- set [ap_mac|sta_mac] _xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx_: sets the MAC address of the STA and SOFTAP to a user defined value
- scan: does a scan for APs
- set ap_on [0|1]: selects, whether the soft-AP is disabled (ap_on=0) or enabled (ap_on=1, default)
- set ap_open [0|1]: selects, whether the soft-AP uses WPA2 security (ap_open=0,  automatic, if an ap_password is set) or open (ap_open=1)
- set ssid_hidden [0|1]: selects, whether the SSID of the soft-AP is hidden (ssid_hidden=1) or visible (ssid_hidden=0, default)
- set phy_mode [1|2|3]: sets the PHY_MODE of the WiFi (1=b, 2=g, 3=n(default))
- set speed [80|160]: sets the CPU clock frequency (default 80 Mhz)
- set status_led _GPIOno_: selects a GPIO pin for the status LED (default 2, >16 disabled)
- set [upstream_kbps|downstream_kbps] _bitrate_: sets a maximum upstream/downstream bitrate (0 = no limit) 
- set vmin _voltage_: sets the minimum battery voltage in mV. If Vdd drops below, the ESP goes into deep sleep. If 0, nothing happens
- set vmin_sleep _time_: sets the time interval in seconds the ESP sleeps on low voltage
- set config_port _portno_: sets the port number of the console login (default is 7777, 0 disables remote console config)
- set web_port _portno_: sets the port number of the web config server (default is 80, 0 disables web config)
- set config_access _mode_: controls the networks that allow config access for console and web (0: no access, 1: only internal, 2: only external, 3: both (default))
- portmap add [TCP|UDP] _external_port_ _internal_ip_ _internal_port_: adds a port forwarding
- portmap remove [TCP|UDP] _external_port_: deletes a port forwarding
- monitor [on|off|acl] _port_: starts and stops monitor server on a given port
- acl [from_sta|to_sta] [TCP|UDP|IP] _src-ip_ [_src_port_] _desr-ip_ [_dest_port_] [allow|deny|allow_monitor|deny_monitor]: adds a new rule to the ACL
- acl [from_sta|to_sta] clear: clears the whole ACL
- show acl: shows the defined ACLs and some stats
- set acl_debug [0|1]: switches ACL debug output on/off - a denied packets will be logged to the terminal

# Status LED
In default config GPIO2 is configured to drive a status LED (connected to GND) with the following indications:
- permanently on: started, but not successfully connected to the AP (no valid external IP)
- flashing (1 per second): working, connected to the AP
- unperiodically flashing: working, traffic in the internal network

With "set status_led GPIOno" the GPIO pin can be changed (any value > 16, e.g. "set status_led 255" will disable the status LED completely). When configured to GPIO1, it works with the buildin blue LED on the ESP-01 boards. However, as GPIO1 ist also the UART-TX-pin this means, that the serial console is not working. Configuration is then limited to network access.

# Port Mapping
In order to allow clients from the external network to connect to server port on the internal network, ports have to be mapped. An external port is mapped to an internal port of a specific internal IP address. Use the "portmap add" command for that. Port mappings can be listed with the "show" command and are saved with the current config. 

However, to make sure that the expected device is listening at a certain IP address, it has to be ensured the this devices has the same IP address once it or the ESP is rebooted. To achive this, either fixed IP adresses can be configured in the devices or the ESP has to remember its DHCP leases. This can be achived with the "save dhcp" command. It saves the current state and all DHCP leases, so that they will be restored after reboot. DHCP leases can be listed with the "show stats" command.

# Monitoring
From the console a monitor service can be started ("monitor on [portno]"). This service mirrors the traffic of the internal network in pcap format to a TCP stream. E.g. with a "netcat [external_ip_of_the_repeater] [portno] | sudo wireshark -k -S -i -" from an computer in the external network you can now observe the traffic in the internal network in real time. Use this e.g. to observe with which internet sites your internals clients are communicating. Be aware that this at least doubles the load on the esp and the WiFi network. Under heavy load this might result in some packets beeing cut short or even dropped in the monitor session. CAUTION: leaving this port open is a potential security issue. Anybody from the local networks can connect and observe your traffic.

# Firewall
The ESP router has a integrated basic firewall. ACLs (Access Control Lists) can be applied to the SoftAP interface. This is a cornerstone in IoT security, when the router is used to bring other IoT devices into the internet. It can be used to prevent e.g. third-party IoT devices from "calling home", being misused as malware bots, and to protect your home network with PCs, tablets and phones from being visible to home automation devices. 

The two ACL lists are named "from_sta" and "to_sta" for incoming and outgoing packets. ACLs are defined in "CISCO IOS style". The following example will allow for outgoing local broadcasts (for DHCP), UDP 53 (DNS), and TCP 1883 (MQTT) to a local broker, any other packets will be blocked:
- acl from_sta clear
- acl from_sta IP any 255.255.255.255 allow
- acl from_sta UDP any any any 53 allow
- acl from_sta TCP any any 192.168.0.0/16 1883 allow
- acl from_sta IP any any deny

ACLs for the "to_sta" direction may be defined as well, but this is usually not required, as the reverse direction is quite well protected against unsolicited traffic by the NAT transation.

ACLs consist of filtering rules that are processed for each packet. Each rule consists of a protocol (IP, TCP, or UDP), source address/port, destination address/port, as well as an action "allow" or "deny". In case of plain IP no ports, only addresses are given. IP rules include TCP and UDP packets. Addresses can be given as subnet addresses in the "/" notation, e.g. 192.168.178.0/24. Also "any" can be used as wildcard, it matches on any address or portnumber. A rule is defined by the "acl" command:

- acl [from_sta|to_sta] [TCP|UDP|IP] _src-ip_ [_src_port_] _desr-ip_ [_dest_port_] [allow|deny|allow_monitor|deny_monitor]

The rules are processed top-down in the order of their appearance in the list. The first rule that matches a packet is applied and determies whether a packet is allowed (and forwarded) or denied (and dropped). This means, special cases first, general rules at the end. If there are rules in an ACL all packets that don't match any rule are denied by default. Thus, the last rule "from_sta IP any any deny" in the example above is not really needed, as it is the default anyway. If an ACL is empty, all packets are allowed.

Definition of ACL rules works also top-down: a new rule is always added at the end of a list. To change an ACL you first have to clear it completely (acl from_sta clear) and then rebuild it. ACLs are saved with the config. "show acl" will print out the ACLs plus statistics on the number of hits for each rule and the overall number of allowed and denied packets.

With the command "set acl_debug 1" a summary of all denied packets is printed to the console. Also, an MQTT topic can publishe this summary. This can be used for firewall configuration to determine which rules are required to get the connected devices working. It also gives a hint if, if unexpected traffic happens (and is denied). 

For deeper analysis the monitoring service can be used (even denied packets are reported to the monitor before they are dropped). When the monitor is started with the "monitor acl _port_" command, ACLs can be used as online filters. All rules that are defined as 
"allow_monitor" instead of "allow" and "deny_monitor" instead of "deny" are processed as usual, resulting in allowing of forwarding a packet, but they also send the packet to the monitor. Thus a list of rules that basically "allow" or "allow_monitor" all packets still makes sense, as it can be used to select already during catpure time which packet should be recorded. E.g. a lists:

- acl from_sta clear
- acl from_sta IP 192.168.0.0/16 any allow_monitor
- acl from_sta IP any any allow

- acl to_sta clear
- acl to_sta IP any 192.168.0.0/16 allow_monitor
- acl to_sta IP any any allow

will allow all packets and also select all packets for monitoring that go from a station to the 192.168.0.0/16 (local)subnet and from the 192.168.0.0/16 to a station. Of course such a filter can be applied also after the capture to a full monitoring trace, but if you already know, what you are looking for, these online filters will help to reduce monitoring overhead drastically. It can also be used to debug all deny firewall rules by simply using "deny_monitor" instead of deny.

# Bitrate Limits
By setting upstream_kbps and downstream_kbps to a value != 0 (0 is the default), you can limit the maximum bitrate of the ESP's AP. This value is a limit that applies to the traffic of all connected clients. Packets that would exeed the defined bitrate are dropped. The traffic shaper uses the "Token Bucket" algorithm with a bucket size of currently four times the bitrate per seconds, allowing for bursts, when there was no traffic before.

# MQTT Support
Since version 1.3 the router has a build-in MQTT client (thanks to Tuan PM for his library https://github.com/tuanpmt/esp_mqtt). This can help to integrate the router/repeater into the IoT. A home automation system can e.g. make decisions based on infos about the currently associated stations, it can switch on and of the repeaters (e.g. based on a time schedule), or it can simply be used to monitor the load. The router can be connected either to a local MQTT broker or to a publically available broker in the cloud. However, currently it does not support TLS encryption.

By default the MQTT client is disabled. It can be enabled by setting the config parameter "mqtt_host" to a hostname different from "none". To configure MQTT you can set the following parameters:
- set mqtt_host _IP_or_hostname_: IP or hostname of the MQTT broker ("none" disables the MQTT client)
- set mqtt_user _username_: Username for authentication ("none" if no authentication is required at the broker)
- set mqtt_user _password_: Password for authentication
- set mqtt_id _clientId_: Id of the client at the broker (default: "ESPRouter_xxxxxx" derived from the MAC address)
- set mqtt_prefix _prefix_path_: Prefix for all published topics (default: "/WiFi/ESPRouter_xxxxxx/system", again derived from the MAC address)
- set mqtt_command_topic _command_topic_: Topic subscribed to receive commands, same as from the console. (default: "/WiFi/ESPRouter_xxxxxx/command", "none" disables commands via MQTT)
- set mqtt_interval _secs_: Set the interval in which the router publishs status topics (default: 15s, 0 disables status publication)
- set mqtt_mask _mask_in_hex_: Selects which topics are published (default: "ffff" means all)

The MQTT parameters can be displayed with the "show mqtt" command.

The router can publish the following status topics periodically (every mqtt_interval):
- _prefix_path_/Uptime: System uptime since last reset in s (mask: 0x0020)
- _prefix_path_/Vdd: Voltage of the power supply in mV (mask: 0x0040)
- _prefix_path_/Bpsin: Bytes/s from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0800)
- _prefix_path_/Bpsout: Bytes/s from the AP to stations (mask: 0x1000)
- _prefix_path_/Ppsin: Packets/s from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0200)
- _prefix_path_/Ppsout: Packets/s from the AP to stations  (mask: 0x0400)
- _prefix_path_/Bin: Total bytes from stations into the AP (mask: 0x0100)
- _prefix_path_/Bout: Total bytes from the AP to stations  (mask: 0x0100)
- _prefix_path_/NoStations: Number of stations currently connected to the AP  (mask: 0x2000)

In addition it can publish on an event basis:
- _prefix_path_/join: MAC address of a station joining the AP (mask: 0x0008)
- _prefix_path_/leave: MAC address of a station leaving the AP (mask: 0x0010)
- _prefix_path_/IP: IP address of the router when received via DHCP (mask: 0x0002)
- _prefix_path_/ScanResult: Separate topic for the results of a "scan" command (one message per found AP) (mask: 0x0004)
- _prefix_path_/ACLDeny: A packet has been denied by an ACL rule and has been dropped (mask: 0x0080)

The router can be configured using the following topics:
- _command_topic_: The router subscribes on this topic and interprets all messages as command lines
- _prefix_path_/response: The router publishes on this topic the command line output (mask: 0x0001)

If you now want the router to publish e.g. only Vdd, its IP, and the command line output, set the mqtt_mask to 0x0001 | 0x0002 | 0x0040 (= "set mqtt_mask 0043").

# Power Management
The repeater monitors its current supply voltage (shown in the "show stats" command). If _vmin_ (in mV, default 0) is set to a value > 0 and the supply voltage drops below this value, it will go into deep sleep mode for _vmin_sleep_ seconds. If you have connected GPIO16 to RST (which is hard to solder on an ESP-01) it will reboot after this interval, try to reconnect, and will continue its measurements. If _vmin_ is saved with the config, it will sleep over and over again, until the supply voltage raises above the threshold. These settings are especially (only?) useful if you have powered the ESP with a (lithium) battery whithout undercharge protection. Then a value of 2900mV-3000mV is probably helpful, as it reduces power consumption of the ESP to a minimum and you have much more time to recharge or replace the battery before damage. This only makes sense, if you have the ESP connected directly to the battery. If you have additional logic, this will still drain the battery.

You can send the ESP to sleep manually once by using the "sleep" command.

Caution: If you save a _vmin_ value higher than the max supply voltage to flash, the repeater will immediatly shutdown every time after reboot. Then you have to wipe out the whole config by flashing blank.bin (or any other file) to 0x0c000.

# Building and Flashing
To build this binary you download and install the esp-open-sdk (https://github.com/pfalcon/esp-open-sdk). Make sure, you can compile and download the included "blinky" example.

Then download this source tree in a separate directory and adjust the BUILD_AREA variable in the Makefile and any desired options in user/user_config.h. Build the esp_wifi_repeater firmware with "make". "make flash" flashes it onto an esp8266.

The source tree includes a binary version of the liblwip_open plus the required additional includes from my fork of esp-open-lwip. *No additional install action is required for that.* Only if you don't want to use the precompiled library, checkout the sources from https://github.com/martin-ger/esp-open-lwip . Use it to replace the directory "esp-open-lwip" in the esp-open-sdk tree. "make clean" in the esp_open_lwip dir and once again a "make" in the upper esp_open_sdk directory. This will compile a liblwip_open.a that contains the NAT-features. Replace liblwip_open_napt.a with that binary.

If you want to use the complete precompiled firmware binaries you can flash them with "esptool.py --port /dev/ttyUSB0 write_flash -fs 32m 0x00000 firmware/0x00000.bin 0x10000 firmware/0x10000.bin" (use -fs 8m for an ESP-01)

On Windows you can flash it using the "ESP8266 Download Tool" available at https://espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools. Download the two files 0x00000.bin and 0x10000.bin from the firmware directory. For a generic ESP12, a NodeMCU or a Wemos D1 use the following settings (for an ESP-01 change FLASH SIZE to "8Mbit"):

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/martin-ger/esp_wifi_repeater/master/FlashRepeaterWindows.jpg">

For some reasons that I still do not understand, the firmware compiled with the V2.0.0 SDK fails to start on some ESP-01 modules. If you experience these problem, use the files from the directory firmware_sdk_1.5.4 instead (addresses 0x00000 and 0x40000).

If your downloaded firmware doesn't start properly, please check with the enclosed checksums whether the binary files are possibly corrupted.

# Known Issues
- Due to the limitations of the ESP's SoftAP implementation, there is a maximum of 8 simultaniously connected stations.
- Configuration via TCP (write_flash) requires a good power supply. A large capacitor between Vdd and Gnd can help if you experience problems here.
